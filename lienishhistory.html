        <h3><i>Republic of Hwamba</i></h3>
        <p>Campaign of creating our micronation begun on 26th of November in 2019 year. It was the birthday of our
            President, Mikhail N. His Mom's friend granted him a book How to Build Your Own Country by Valery Wyatt. This
            book was about micronations and how create them. First attempt of creating micronation was on 4th of December
            in 2019 year. That micronation's name was Hwamba. Unfortunately, Hwamba was very weak and simple nation. it
            didn't have any money, constitution and laws. Only president and some territories.</p>

    <h3><i>Creating of Lienia</i></h3>
        <p>Unfortunately Hwamba's destiny was sad - it has broken after year of existing because of lack of government's
            control (but micronations often become weak or die because of this reason). Then Mikhail realized, what he
            needs to create idea of country (like its constitution and money), and <i>just after this </i> create country.
            His country name was Lienia. He didn't hurry with creating of Lienia. He remembered the Hwambian experience,
            so first, he created all government etc., and just then created Lienia. Actually, Lienia become independent
            in 22nd of January in 2022, but its constitution was written three months earlier!</p>
