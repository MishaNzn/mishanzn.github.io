        <h3><i>Republic of Hwamba</i></h3>
        <p>Campaign of creating of micronations begun on 26th of November in 2021 year. It was the birthday of our
            President, Mikhail N. His Mom's friend granted him a book How to Build Your Own Country by Valery Wyatt. This
            book was about micronations and how create them. First attempt of creating micronation was on 4th of December
            in 2019 year. That micronation's name was Hwamba. Unfortunately, Hwamba was very weak and simple nation. She
            didn't have any money, constitution and laws. Only president and some territories.</p>
        <h3><i>Creating of Lienia</i></h3>
        <p>Unfortunately Hwamba's destiny was sad - it has broken after year of existing because of lack of government's
            control. Then Mikhail realized, what you need to create idea of country (like its constitution and money),
            and <i>just after this </i> create country. His country name was Lienia. He didn't hurry with creating of
            Lienia. He remembered the Hwambian experience, so first, he created all government etc., and just then
            created Lienia. Unfortunately, now Lienia is a president republic until it get full independence (technically,
            Lienia still dependence until  Act of Independence).</p>
