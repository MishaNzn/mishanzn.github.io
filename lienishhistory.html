    <div id="lienishbackground">
        <h3><i>Lienish Background</i></h3>
        <p>Campaign of creating our micronation begun on 26th of November in 2019 year. It was 10th birthday of our
            President, Mićaöl Lienere. His Mom's friend granted him a book How to Build Your Own Country by Valery
            Wyatt. This book was about micronations and how create them. First attempt of creating micronation was on
            4th of December in 2019 year. That micronation's name was Hwamba. Unfortunately, Hwamba was very weak and
            simple nation. It didn't have any money, constitution and laws. Only a president and some territories.
            Unfortunately Hwamba's destiny was sad - it has stopped its existence after year of functioning because of
            lack of government's control (but micronations often become weak or die because of this reason). Then
            Mićaöl realized, what he needs to create first of all idea of country (like its constitution, flag and
            culture), and <i>just after this </i> create country.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="2021">
        <h3><i>2021</i></h3>
        <p>Mićaöl didn't hurry with creating of Lienia. He remembered the Hwambian experience, so first, he
            created basic government and culture etc., and just then created Lienia. Actually, Lienia become independent
            in 22nd of January in 2022, but its constitution was written three months earlier! 2021 year was very
            important year of Lienish history - it was year, when (almost) all Lienish ideas and projects became true -
            constitution, web-page, currency etc. The only main date of 2021 is 25 October - date of Lienish founding,
            when President wrote constitution, act of independence, drew flag and invented language. That period of
            Lienish history ended at 24th February 2022.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="2022">
        <h3><i>2022</i></h3>
        <p>With beginning of Ukrainian-Russian war at 24th February Lienia left Ukraine. This period also known as West
                Travel. President and Prime Minister were big heroes - they took Lienia, its documents and currency
                with them, in Travel. West Travel ended at 3rd March 2022 with arriving Lienia in Germany. (<i>
                President had a sad joke, what from now Lienish history will become more interesting</i>). When Lienia
                arrived Germany (it is also known as "Changing of Macronation"), it woke up of short (1 week) period of
                inactivity, which has begun (and ended) with West Travel. It recovered from Travel at 9th March and
                begun new Era of Lienish history.</p>
