        <h3><i>Lienia - what is that?</i></h3>
        <p>Lienia <i>[li'e:niʌ]</i> (full name is Lienish Sovereign Republic) - is a powerful and wealthy micronation. 
	    This is not a joke. Micronation is a <i>nation which has its own citizens and culture but which has not been
	    recognized as legitimate by the established countries of the world</i>. Our micronation has been created in 
	    25th of October in 2021 year by Mikhail Nieviezhyn, and it is actively growing each day. Now Lienia has its 
	    own flag, citizens, language and even Constitution and money! Now we are working for making colonies in free
            from other countries lands and for organizing the Senate.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Are you a colony of any country?</i></h3>
        <p>No! Like we told you earlier, we are a <i>micronation</i>. Micronation - it is like country, just small and
            unofficial. There are many micronations in the world: Kingdom of Talossa, Sealand, Molossia, Aerican Empire,
            (and it is just the most powerful and popular of them!) etc. They all have their own President or King,
            territory, citizens, money and laws. We have all of it too. We also have something very important to every
            nation - it is sovereignty. We are not a colony, dominion or part of any nation! We are the independence,
            sovereign and growing with every second country.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Do you have any territories or citizens?</i></h3>
        <p>Yes, of course - country without it is not a country. Now Lienia has 2,8 square meters (30.1 square feet)
            of territory. Maybe it is not a lot of territories, but for micronations it is not bad. Plus one day we will
            buy a little land and put Lienia there (and we are thinking about making colonies in Arctica and islands of
            Pacific Ocean). Now about citizens. We already have 1 man. Plus there are 4 people soon will be a citizens,
            and we will have 5 citizens - it is more, than Molossia has! Because of our little territory 5 citizens is
            our limit now, but if and when we settle in our future colonies, we think we can have more people.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>What do you mean - "your future colonies"?</i></h3>
        <p>Of course our territory is too little for 5 people, so we are working on putting Lienia in our colonies. <i>
            If you don't know - colonies is a dependence from other countries lands.</i> We will not do an occupation -
            we will do all plus-minus legal: buy a land about 2000 square meters (21400 square feet) - it's like 2
            soccer fields - and put all our country in there. As plan B we have next thought: we will look on satellite
            photos or swim in oceans to looking for a little islands which other countries has not taken.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Is your country serious?</i></h3>
        <p>Yes, of course it is! Don't be confused by word "micronation" - in our opinion micronations has same rights,
        as real nations of the world! Maybe our nation hasn't constitution with a million of articles or atom bombs and
	tanks, but we have all what we need to be country: independence, government, culture, laws, territory, money, 
	we even have language and citizens. If we have all of it (and this is the most important to every country thing),
	so why we can't be a country?
    </p>
        </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Can I become a citizen of Lienia?</i></h3>
        <p>We are deeply sorry, but no. Lienia has very little territory - 2,8² meters (it is like a blanket!). But we
            are thinking about make colonies if Pacific Ocean and make towns in there, so maybe one day in a future...
            Besides, maybe we can try to make cyber-citizenship (it's when you answer on a questions, of course
            online, like "What is your real name" and "In which country you live") and become cyber almost-citizen
              of some micronation. Lot of micronation can't have many real citizens because of territory and
            neighborhood countries, so this is a popular variant to get some people.</p>
