        <h3><i>Lienia - what is that?</i></h3>
        <p>Lienia <i>[li'e:niʌ]</i> (its full name is Lienish Sovereign Republic) - is a powerful and
            wealthy <a
                    href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Micronation"
                    title="Definition of word ″micronation″ by MicroWiki - micronational Wiki"
                    target="_blank">micronation</a>.
            This is not a joke. Micronation is a <i>little and "<i>toy</i>" nation which has its own citizens,
                government and
                culture but which has not been recognized as legitimate by the established countries of the
                world</i>.
            Our micronation has been created in 25th of October in 2021 year by Mićaöl Lienere, and it is
            actively
            growing each day. Now Lienia has its own flag, citizens, language, Constitution and even its own
            video games
            and money! Now we are working for beginning diplomatic relations with other micronations and
            creating our
            economy.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Are you a colony of any country?</i></h3>
        <p>No! Like we told you earlier, we are a <i>micronation</i>. Micronation - it is like country, just
            small and
            unofficial. There are many micronations in the world: Karno-Ruthenia, Sealand, Molossia, Aerican
            Empire,
            Austenasia, Sasperian (and those are just ones of the most powerful and popular of them - totally
            there are
            around 600+ micronations in the world!) etc. They all have their own President or King,
            territory, citizens,
            money and laws. We have all of it too. We also have something very important to every nation -
            it is
            sovereignty. We are not a colony, dominion or part of any nation! We are the independence,
            sovereign and
            growing with every second country.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Do you have any territories or citizens?</i></h3>
        <p>Yes, of course - country without it is not a country. Now Lienia has 2,8 square meters (30.1
            square feet)
            of territory. Maybe it is not a lot of territories, but for micronations it is not bad. Plus one
            day it very
            possibly we get a little land (around 1 Acr) and put Lienia there. Now about citizens. We
            already had 1 man
            when Lienia was founded (me). Plus there are 4 people in December 2021 and 1 in March 2022 became citizens,
            and now we have 6
            citizens - it is more, than Molossia has! Because of our little territory 6 citizens is our
            limit now.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Is your country serious?</i></h3>
        <p>Yes, of course it is! Don't be confused by word "micronation" - in our opinion micronations has
            same rights, as real nations of the world! Maybe our nation hasn't constitution with a million of articles
            or atom bombs and tanks, but we have all what we need to be country: independence, government, culture,
            laws, territory, money, we even have real invented language and citizens, who are living on our territory.
            If we have all of it (and this is the most important to every country things), so why we can't be a country?
            Micronations around whole world claims sovereignty and independence - if they can parody real countries (and
            some of them doing it really well indeed), so we too!
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Can I become a citizen of Lienia?</i></h3>
        <p>We are deeply sorry, but no. Lienia
            has very little territory - 2,8² meters (around 30 feet - it is like a blanket!). We already have 6 citizens;
            if we divide our lands, every citizen will get 0,46 square metres of land - imagine! Because of it, Lienish
            government has to give citizenship very accurately, choosing only from people checked by President & Co. 
            We will not accept nor exmine requests from other people - their letters will be moved directly to trash.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h3><i>What if I have a micronation, and I want to begin diplomatic relations with Lienia?</i></h3>
        <p>It is simple - just read our <a href="lienishgovernment.html#diplomaticpolicy">diplomatic
            policy</a> and then
            mail to our Minister of Foreign Affairs in <a href="contactus.html">Contact Us</a> page. We
            will be pretty
            happy if we make relations with another micronations. In your letter please specify name of your
            country,
            its political system and website (if you have one). If you violate our diplomatic policy, we end
            our
            relations.
