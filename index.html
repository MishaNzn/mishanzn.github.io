    <h1 style="text-align:left"><i><b>Welcome to Lienia!</b></i></h1>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Lienia - what is that?</i></h3>
        <p>Lienia <i>[li'e:niʌ]</i> (full name is Lienish Sovereign Republic) - is a powerful and wealthy micronation.
            This is not a joke. Micronation is a <i>nation which has its own citizens and culture but which has not been
                recognized as legitimate by the established countries of the world</i>. Our micronation has been created
            in 25th of October in 2021 year by Mikhail N, and it is actively growing each day. Now Lienia has its own
            flag, citizens, language and even Constitution and money! Now we are working for beginning diplomatic
            relations with other micronations and for .</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Are you a colony of any country?</i></h3>
        <p>No! Like we told you earlier, we are a <i>micronation</i>. Micronation - it is like country, just small and
            unofficial. There are many micronations in the world: Kingdom of Talossa, Sealand, Molossia, Aerican Empire,
            (and it is just the most powerful and popular of them!) etc. They all have their own President or King,
            territory, citizens, money and laws. We have all of it too. We also have something very important to every
            nation - it is sovereignty. We are not a colony, dominion or part of any nation! We are the independence,
            sovereign and growing with every second country.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Do you have any territories or citizens?</i></h3>
        <p>Yes, of course - country without it is not a country. Now Lienia has 2,8 square meters (30.1 square feet)
            of territory. Maybe it is not a lot of territories, but for micronations it is not bad. Plus one day we will
            buy a little land and put Lienia there (and we are thinking about making colonies in Arctica and islands of
            Pacific Ocean). Now about citizens. We already had 1 man (me). Plus there are 4 people not so long ago
            become citizens, and now we have 5 citizens - it is more, than Molossia has! Because of our little territory
            5 citizens is our limit now, but if and when we settle in our future colonies, we think we can have more
            people.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>What do you mean - "your future colonies"?</i></h3>
        <p>Of course our territory is too little for 5 people, so we are working on putting Lienia in our colonies. <i>
            If you don't know - colonies is a dependence from other countries lands.</i> We will not do an occupation -
            we will do all plus-minus legal: buy a land about 2000 square meters (21400 square feet) - it's like 2
            soccer fields - and put all our country in there. As plan B we have next thought: we will look on satellite
            photos or swim in oceans to looking for a little islands which other countries has not taken.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Is your country serious?</i></h3>
        <p>Yes, of course it is! Don't be confused by word "micronation" - in our opinion micronations has same rights,
            as real nations of the world! Maybe our nation hasn't constitution with a million of articles or atom bombs
            and tanks, but we have all what we need to be country: independence, government, culture, laws, territory,
            money, we even have language and citizens. If we have all of it (and this is the most important to every
            country thing), so why we can't be a country?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Can I become a citizen of Lienia?</i></h3>
        <p>We are deeply sorry, but no. Lienia has very little territory - 2,8² meters (it is like a blanket!). But we
            are thinking about make colonies if Pacific Ocean and make towns in there, so maybe one day in a future...
            Besides, maybe we can try to make cyber-citizenship. Lot of micronation can't have many real citizens (some
            micronation, Like Aerica, haven't real citizens, just cyber) because of territory and anger of neighborhood
            countries, so this is a popular variant to get some people.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>What if I have a micronation, and I want to begin diplomatic relations with Lienia?</i></h3>
        <p>It is simple - just read our <a href="lienishgovernment.html#diplomaticpolicy">diplomatic policy</a> and then
            mail to our Foreign Secretary <a href="mailto:nie.misha.ua@gmail.com">here</a>. In your letter please
            specify name of your country, its political system and website (if you have it). If you violate our
            diplomatic policy, we end our relations.
