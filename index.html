    <h1 style="text-align:left"><i><b>Welcome to Lienia!</b></i></h1>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Lienia - what is that?</i></h3>
        <p>Lienia <i>[li'e:niʌ]</i> (its full name is Lienish Sovereign Republic) - is a powerful and wealthy <a
                href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Micronation"
                title="Definition of word micronation by MicroWiki - micronational Wiki"
                target="_blank">micronation.</a>
            This is not a joke. Micronation is a <i>"toy" and little nation which has its own citizens and culture but
            which has not been recognized as legitimate by the established countries of the world</i>. Our micronation
            has been created in 25th of October in 2021 year by Mikhail N, and it is actively growing each day. Now
            Lienia has its own flag, citizens, language and even Constitution and money! Now we are working for
            beginning diplomatic relations with other micronations and creating our economy.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Are you a colony of any country?</i></h3>
        <p>No! Like we told you earlier, we are a <i>micronation</i>. Micronation - it is like country, just small and
            unofficial. There are many micronations in the world: Karno-Ruthenia, Sealand, Molossia, Aerican Empire,
            Austenasia (and this is just one of the most powerful and popular of them - totally there are around 600+
            micronations in the world!) etc. They all have their own President or King, territory, citizens, money and
            laws. We have all of it too. We also have something very important to every nation - it is sovereignty. We
            are not a colony, dominion or part of any nation! We are the independence, sovereign and growing with every
            second country.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Do you have any territories or citizens?</i></h3>
        <p>Yes, of course - country without it is not a country. Now Lienia has 2,8 square meters (30.1 square feet)
            of territory. Maybe it is not a lot of territories, but for micronations it is not bad. Plus one day it very
            possibly we get a little land (around 1 Acr) and put Lienia there. Now about citizens. We already had 1 man
            when Lienia was founded (me). Plus there are 4 people in December 2021 became citizens, and now we have 5
            citizens - it is more, than Molossia has! Because of our little territory 5 citizens is our limit now, but
            if and when we settle in our future colonies, we think we can have more people.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>What do you mean - "your future colonies"?</i></h3>
        <p>Of course our territory is too little for 5 people, so we are working on putting Lienia in our colonies. <i>
            If you don't know - colonies is a dependence from other countries lands.</i> We will not do any occupation -
            we will do all plus-minus legal: buy a land about 2,000 square meters (21,400 square feet) - it's like 2
            soccer fields - and put all our country in there. As plan B we have next thought: we will look on satellite
            photos or swim in oceans to looking for a little islands in oceans which other countries has not taken. We
            can also build islands <i>ourselves</i> from empty bottles and cover them with sand - some people like
            Reishee Sowa have successfully done that. Now Sowa's island has a river, 2 beaches and washing machine. If
            he did it, so why we can't?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Is your country serious?</i></h3>
        <p>Yes, of course it is! Don't be confused by word "micronation" - in our opinion micronations has same rights,
            as real nations of the world! Maybe our nation hasn't constitution with a million of articles or atom bombs
            and tanks, but we have all what we need to be country: independence, government, culture, laws, territory,
            money, we even have language and citizens. If we have all of it (and this is the most important to every
            country thing), so why we can't be a country?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>Can I become a citizen of Lienia?</i></h3>
        <p>We are deeply sorry, but no. Lienia has very little territory - 2,8² meters (it is like a blanket!). We
            already have 5 citizens; if we divide our lands, every citizen will get 0,5 square metres of land - imagine!
            But we are thinking about where whe can make colonies (some variants - islands in Pacific Ocean, Mary Byrd
            Land, Bir Tawil etc.) and make Lienish towns and cities, so, I don't know - maybe one day in a future...
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><i>What if I have a micronation, and I want to begin diplomatic relations with Lienia?</i></h3>
        <p>It is simple - just read our <a href="lienishgovernment.html#diplomaticpolicy">diplomatic policy</a> and then
            mail to our Minister of Foreign Affairs <a href="mailto:nie.misha.ua@gmail.com">here</a>. We will be pretty
            happy if we make relations with another micronations. In your letter please specify name of your country,
            its political system and website (if you have one). If you violate our diplomatic policy, we end our
            relations.
